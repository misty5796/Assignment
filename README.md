# Assignment

Sorry I'm too new to Unreal Engine I use too much time on struggling how the library use and how it actually link to Unreal Engine from C++. 
Yea, here is some of my result. Although I know it's incomplete but but deadline in 3 hours more. I'm tired right now :(
Anyway I feel it's so fun to develop game. If I have oppoturnity to join RICRYM company I will do my best to learn it and pick it up fast. 
Thank you!
